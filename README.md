# Classification Machine Learning Models


## Feature Selection - RFE with Cross-Validation RFECV

Select the predictors based on the importance rankings.

Data - Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Takeaway:
- Optimal number of features identified based on accuracy using a Random Forest Estimator

## Telecom Churn Prediction Using Random Forest vs Neural Networks (Keras)

Statistically 59% of customers don’t return after a bad customer service experience.

Data - Kaggle Telco Dataset

Churn: Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No)

Takeaway:
- Random Forests requires less preprocessing and the training process is also much simpler.
- Hyper-parameter tuning is easier with random forest when compared to neural networks
