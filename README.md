# Classification Machine Learning Models


## Feature Selection - RFE with Cross-Validation RFECV

Select the predictors based on the importance rankings.

Data - Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Takeaway:
- Optimal number of features identified based on accuracy using a Random Forest Estimator




## Telecom Churn Prediction Using Random Forest vs Neural Networks (Keras)

Statistically 59% of customers don’t return after a bad customer service experience.

Data - Kaggle Telco Dataset

Churn: Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No)

Takeaway:
- Random Forests requires less preprocessing and the training process is also much simpler.
- Hyper-parameter tuning is easier with random forest when compared to neural networks

## Telemarketing - Classification Model Comparison

Predictive Model to help  telemarketing team concentrate resources on more promising clients first.

Model Comparison:
- Linear Regression
- KNeighbors
- SVM: Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest Classifier

Data Source - 41,118 Bank Data between 2008 and 2013 and contains the results of a telemarketing campaign including customer’s response to the bank’s offer of a deposit contract.
